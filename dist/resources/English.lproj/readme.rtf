\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Fira Sans System Font Replacement\

\b0 \
These fonts are intended as a system font replacement on Mac OS X 10.12 Sierra.\
\
They are based on the Fira Sans font family and are licensed under the Open Font License version 1.1 or later. This package has been prepared by Jens Kutilek <https://github.com/jenskutilek/FiraSystemFontReplacement>.\
\

\b After Installation\

\b0 \
It is recommended to shut down, turn off, and restart your computer to finish installation of the fonts. A simple reboot may lead to garbled dialogs, so a complete shutdown is highly recommended. This is necessary only once.\
\

\b How To Uninstall\

\b0 \
Delete or move the font files FSDisplay.ttf and FSText.ttf from the /Library/Fonts folder and restart your computer.\
